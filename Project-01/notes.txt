Note:- Python 3.12 Runtime in AWS Lambda does not have many libraries inbuilt as of yet so i have used AWS ARN for libraries for Pillow in this project. 
       Please find file named "klayers-ap-south-1-p3.12" which contains the AWS ARNs for libraries for python 3.12

        You can use the create_s3_bucket.py file to create S# buckets from command-line interface.

        s3_access_policy is the access policy attached to the IAM role used for Project 1. 
        Other than this we provided, AWS Cloudwatch permissions also to IAM role for crreation of Logs Group.
